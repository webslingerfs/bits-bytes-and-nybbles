# Labs ðŸ§ª
This section contains **hands-on lab exercises** that reinforce concepts from networking, security, and automation.

## ðŸ§± Lab Environments
I typically build labs using:
- **GNS3 / EVE-NG** for network simulations
- **VirtualBox / VMware** for security tools
- **Cloud Labs** (AWS, Azure, Cisco DevNet Sandbox)

## ðŸ”¬ Example Labs
| Lab Name | Category | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Routing Convergence | Networking | Compare OSPF vs. EIGRP failover times |
| ClearPass Guest Portal | Security | Implement a device registration workflow |
| Python Config Puller | Automation | Fetch interface data from network devices |

## ðŸ§© Structure
Each lab page will include:
- **Objective**
- **Topology / Diagram**
- **Configuration Steps**
- **Verification**
- **Key Takeaways**

Stay tuned â€” more labs coming soon as I document my CCNP and security studies!
